# FFT-for-tidal-prediction
 This repository contains code which performs FFT-based compression and decompression of Telemac-2D model output datasets. It can be used to predict future tidal resource with a higher degree of accuracy than harmonic analysis. Works best when a year of model data is provided for efficient elucidation of frequencies.
